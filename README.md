# Proximity Reminders iOS App

A to-dos application with a unique feature, like the native Reminders app, the user can set a perimeter when they want to receive the reminder on their phone. Accessing the power of Core Location, the app can detect when a particular boundary is left or entered.

The user can add reminders by tapping the "+" sign at the top right of the start screen. They can enter a reminder, set the location (current or by using the search bar to select one), and when the reminder should be triggered.

API's and frameworks in use:

* Foundation
* UIKit
* Core Location
* MapKit
